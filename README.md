# Simulating-the-XXX-Heisenberg-Spin-Model
â€¢ Constructed quantum circuits to simulate the time evolution. Some ideas of circuit designing was from the reference( you can find the sitation inside).

I also take the effects from the quantum noise into account, therefore how to mitigate the error was also studied in this project. 
The mitigation was quite successful, and eventually achieved 97% State Tomography fidelity.
